Sinatra, what a great name for a gem. During the review for my first project, I had realized that I totally forgot that I had came up with a name for it. When I said it aloud I thought, "damn, what a stupid name". Luckily for me, my cohort lead said she liked it, so I said nothing further. As we come to the sinatra section of things it dawned on me how important a catchy name for your program is. So many companies like google, spotify, facebook (boo), have such powerful names. Makes you wonder if the name follows the success or vice versa. 

Moving forward I plan on putting more emphasis on this.
