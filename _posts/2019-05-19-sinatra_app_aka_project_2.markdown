So last project I made a blog post giving some tips for succeeding in your project. I figured on this go around I can do the same thing. Here are the 3 biggest things that helped me:

* Use it, a lot- You should spend a very large amount of time using your app as someone would in real life. This is a great way to uncover bugs and unintended effects of shoddy code. It is also a great way to think of new features to add!

*  Have your friends use it - It is very easy to lose track of the big picture when you're down in the weeds of programming. Have a friend (or friends) use it too. They can do all the things mentioned above for you, and show you things you might not have thought of on your own. It's also a great way to flex on them. 

* Don't wait to ask for help - Pride is a dangerous thing. It made me want to get past my obstacles on my own. However, sometimes the problem is a really small, simple thing and asking someone can save you literal hours. Don't get me wrong, you should definitely try to "figure it out" on your own first. Just be mindful of your time and the other tasks you set out to accomplish.


Well I hope that helps you in your project. Good luck!
