We recently have started learning Ruby on Rails, the topic of what seems like every coding podcast ever. It's exciting. This is really the first section that starts to make me feel like I'm really doing this (think I said this for sinatra too).  

Rails is powerful. Too powerful. So powerful, that I feel like I'm almost doing nothing. Even though I know the framework is extremely useful, I can't help but feel like I am being spoiled as a developer. Rails is the over-nurturing nanny who does my homework for me. You want a fully fleshed out app with migrations, models, controllers, routes, and views? Here you go, just write these 5 phrases into your command line and *boosh*. Done.

I guess I'm just jonesin for some Java.
